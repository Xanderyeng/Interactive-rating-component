## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained experience in building interactive components using React and enhancing user experience with animations. I also learned how to structure my components for reusability and maintainability.

Learning how to deploy a React project to GitHub pages when scaffolded with vite was very refreshing. Creating a yaml file which would define the sequence of creating the artifacts required to build and deploy the final project files for hosting.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore more advanced animation techniques and focus on optimizing performance. I'm also excited to further develop my skills in responsive design and UI/UX principles.
